# Google-fit-data
A quick analysis of my Google Fit data over a year-long period. 

* Explored the distributions of daily steps and calorie counts, by analysing their histograms and fitting them to Gaussians.
* Looked at the correlations between different variablesâ€”in particular, Google's measure of "heart points", and how it relates to more objective parameters.
* Plotted out time-series data using rolling averages to see how my trends changed with time, and how they depended on my physical location (home vs university).
